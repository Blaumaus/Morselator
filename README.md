__What is morse code?__\
The Morse code is a long established form of communication. It was widely used for more than a century and provided its value in a variety of areas from land line telegraph systems through to radio communications.

The Morse code is a code that uses a series of dots and dashes to represent the different letters of the alphabet, numbers and procedural notations. In this way it is possible to send a message in Morse code by simply turning a signal on and off in the correct manner to represent the dots and dashes.

In the days of the telegraph a message could be sent using a single wire ( and earth return), and for radio communications it could be implemented by turning the transmitted signal or carrier on and off.

The Morse code itself consisted of two elements: a dot and a dash, and the various letters, numbers and other characters were made up by combining these two elements in different combinations.

By definition a dot is one unit long, and a dash is three units long. Spaces between adjacent dots and dashes are one unit long, the gap between letters is three units long, and between words it is seven.

Often the dot, was represented by the word "di" and the dash by "dah" tending to represent the sound more easily.
